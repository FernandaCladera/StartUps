Liverpool maintained their 100% winning record thanks to Virgil van Dijk's injury-time winner against Atletico Madrid on Wednesday, with all five of their victories earned thanks to goals from the 83rd minute onwards.\nHead coach Arne Slot said after the game that fitness was part of the reason for his team's remarkable record, adding \"our mentality is we will always push\".\nBut just how rare is the Reds' knack for finding late winners and how does it compare to England's other Champions League entrants \u2013 \nWe have looked at those clubs' last five victories in which the winner was scored in or after the 80th minute. Those strikes have to be 'go-ahead goals' to be included. A 90th minute goal to make the score 2-0 won't count, even if the opposition later pull one back to make the final result 2-1.\nUnsurprisingly, none of Liverpool's rivals score late goals at anywhere near the same rate as the Merseysiders, with Arsenal a very distant second. The last five Gunners victories which fit our criteria span 16 months and 64 games, the most recent of which came at Southampton on the final day of last season.\nTottenham rank third, with their last five late wins coming across a run of 79 games, slightly fewer than Chelsea (82) and Manchester City (83), with Newcastle (109) bringing up the rear.\n  2. Newcastle United had more shots on target (six) and a higher xG (1.46) than Barcelona in a 2-1 defeat at St James' Park.\nBut it was the Catalan giants, and Marcus Rashford, that were clinical in front of goal on Thursday.\nThough Anthony Gordon got on the scoresheet late on, this was a night where Newcastle were made to rue not taking their chances when the score was goalless.\nAll the while, record signing Nick Woltemade watched on from the bench for the opening hour as Eddie Howe tried to \"make sure he stays fit\".\nGiven their lack of alternatives up front, Newcastle are conscious of being careful with Woltemade, who came off with cramp on his goalscoring debut against \nIn some ways, this was a night where another new arrival, Yoane Wissa, was missed as a striker who could share the burden with Woltemade.\nBut Wissa picked up a knee injury on international duty with DR Congo and faces a race against time to be fit for the trip to \nSo it would be a huge surprise if Woltemade did not come back into the side at the weekend, particularly with Gordon still serving a domestic ban.\nAnd Newcastle do not have time to dwell on the Barcelona defeat and what might have been following a \"big emotional game\" in the words of Howe.\nNot when facing Bournemouth, who have made their best start to a Premier League season.\n  3. You cannot accuse Ruben Amorim of not being able to laugh at himself.\nThe Manchester United head coach is under huge pressure after his side managed just one win from their opening four league games and got knocked out of the EFL Cup by League Two Grimsby.\nThere has even been suggestions he could be sacked during the October international break unless results turn swiftly.\nMinority owner Sir Jim Ratcliffe flew into United's Carrington training ground on Thursday. The visit was pre-planned but there was a 'crisis' meeting with Amorim.\nI asked the former Sporting coach what the pair spoke about.\nHe was joking. It is good the 40-year-old has not lost his sense of humour.\n  4. _**BBC Radio Nottingham's Forest commentator Colin Fray speaking on the Shut Up And Show More Football podcast:**_\n\"Postecoglou will know as a new head coach coming in, the same as for any head coach, that the sooner he gets a win the better. The sooner he gets a win he gets fans onboard and very importantly, players on board with his ideas.\n\"For Postecoglou, specifically here at Forest, the difficulty for him is he's coming into a side that was really on the up. I know the last game under Nuno against West Ham was shocking. Take that one away, Forest have been a club growing and growing, going up, looking to take the next step. Suddenly, around the time he arrives - and I am not saying he is responsible in any way - they hit a buffer and conceded nine in three games, two games under Postecoglou and one under his predecessor.\n\"He has come in to a dressing room under a Nuno style. He has to get his ideas across, which are different to Nuno's. He has to get them across quickly. With it being so many away games, he doesn't get much time to work on stuff on the training pitch. He's starting now to need to convince more fans. If you are preaching something to employees in any position and it's not getting results, there will be scepticism. \n\"He made 10 changes against Swansea, with another couple at half time. So there were lots of things tried. What it means is he's now had a look at the vast majority of his squad. I think he's now more in a position for the Burnley game and Betis game going forward to make more sound judgments on what his starting XI for each game is going to be. He has not got far more idea about players.\n\"But, he needs to get his selections right, so that he wins a game, quickly.\"\n  5. If West Ham thought they were back on track after beating \nThe most pressing is their leaky defence. They have already conceded a league-high 11 goals, including a remarkable six from corners. \nThat is more than twice as many as any other side, with over a third of all Premier League goals scored from corners this season ending in the Hammers' net.\nEqually as crucial, but perhaps harder to solve, is rediscovering a connection with the fanbase.\nThis will be West Ham's third consecutive home game against London opposition and each of the previous two - against \nFans are entitled to expect better, given the club have spent more than \u00a3250m in the past three transfer windows. Half of that outlay has come under Potter, who has won just six of his 22 league matches. That includes only two home wins, and none since February.\nAnother issue likely to alarm the West Ham board is the increased competitiveness of the newly-promoted sides. In each of the previous two seasons, the newcomers went straight back down without much of a fight, with 27 points theoretically enough to guarantee safety in both campaigns.\nThat may take away a bit of a comfort blanket for any established Premier League teams struggling at the wrong end of the table - and could leave Potter's position in jeopardy unless results improve soon.\n  6. _All season, we are inviting you to send in your questions about Nottingham Forest as part of the BBC's Ask Me Anything service, using_\n_One of the questions this week was about the plans for Forest's stadium so we put it to our reporter Nick Mashiter._\nNottingham Forest owner Evangelos Marinakis wants to increase the City Ground capacity to 50,000. \nThat will have to wait for now but Forest are pushing ahead with plans to expand their home. \nThe proposals will see the existing Peter Taylor Stand demolished and replaced with a 10,000-seater stand, increasing the City Ground's overall capacity to around 42,000.\nFull planning permission was granted by Rushcliffe Borough Council's planning committee in June, with some conditions. \nThese include paying just over \u00a31m to improve local bus services, \u00a3150,000 to upgrade the A60/Cattle Market Road junction and \u00a3200,000 for cycle improvements along Lady Bay Bridge.\nThey must also replace Nottingham Rowing Club's Britannia boathouse, which will be demolished as part of the plans.\nIt ended a long wait for Forest as they had initially announced expansion plans in 2019, meaning the club had even considered leaving the City Ground \nIt was originally expected to cost about \u00a394m but an estimate from earlier this year suggested this has risen to \u00a3130m while a build date is yet to be announced.\n  7. Chelsea fan contributor Nina Hristova feels that the Blues have a lot to learn in the Champions League given the quality on display in the competition.\n  8. We asked for your views on Liverpool's performance against Atletico Madrid, as Arne Slot's side squandered a two-goal lead yet still managed to find a late winner at Anfield.\nLet's be honest, so far this season our performances have been pretty subpar, but I've never been happier. The pure chaos and adrenaline from the way we are winning just can't be matched. I'd prefer all of these games as they have been, rather than straightforward 3-0 wins. To me, the scoreline is nowhere near as important as the entertainment!\nAtletico kept their heads even after going 2-0 down and their first goal had been building for the final 10 minutes of the first half. Liverpool gave them too much space, but they didn't stop pressing. Why though, do we have to bite our nails down to the quick before we get a last-minute winner again? Was it really necessary after being two goals up?\nWe are struggling to break teams down, even though we have a lot of flair and offensive talent.\nOnce again, Liverpool put pressure on themselves with poor defending. This needs addressing. Milos Kerkez is erratic, Andy Robertson is slow and Ibou Konate had some hairy moments again. A very entertaining game, but Liverpool had plenty of chances to put it to bed.\nIt wasn't a polished performance but there were moments that showed how good we're going to be. We are not at our best and we are still winning. I'm loving the Champions League nights.\nMohamed Salah looked hungrier than ever. Whether it was the big European night, playing up to the occasion or feeling the competition with Alexander Isak in the team, it was the first time this season that he's looked dangerous.\n  9. Pat Nevin says there remain question marks over whether his former side Chelsea can dominate games at Champions League level.\nThe Blues began well in their European opener in Munich on Wednesday but errors and naive defending contributed to the 3-1 defeat. \n\"It was the kind of performance I expected,\" Nevin told the Football Daily podcast.\n\"A lot of people were saying to us before that they are just about to break into that elite and they're World Club Champions and I'm thinking 'steady on'.\n\"The jump you need to make when you come to places like this is quite big. A number of players just don't have that experience yet and they have to learn a little bit.\n\"We don't know - they've bought very young players - are they going to be able to dominate games at this level? We don't really know.\n\"You need to learn how to do it and find out if you're good enough and have the personality and then do it for a while.\n\"Chelsea were not able to dominate as a group. They looked a good distance behind Bayern Munich but then many teams who come here do because it's a tough, tough place to come.\"\n  10. **On this week's Albion Unlimited podcast, former Brighton striker Warren Aspinall and BBC Radio Sussex's commentator Jonny Cantor react to Jason Ayto's appointment as Brighton's sporting director after David Weir's departure, and Mike Cave's promotion to the technical director role.**\n\"I was surprised because he [David Weir] was linked with Everton, one of his former clubs, and he batted that away. Then Everton got somebody else,\" Aspinall said.\n\"This came out of the blue. You don't let a good man go if he's doing his job.\n\"I don't know what's gone on or if David's just decided to move back up north.\n\"Jason's been at Arsenal for a long time under Edu, who left in the summer as well. He's done numerous jobs there and lots of players have come and gone. They signed lots of players I would consider to be very good.\n\"Micky Cave has been under the wing for four years at the football club so he knows the ins and outs of the job.\n\"I wish them both all the best and I wish David all the best in his new job.\"\n\"They're quite long-term appointments, aren't they? You can't necessarily see the fruits of their work until a little bit later on.\n\"A lot of people have been very complimentary about the work that he's [Jason Ayto] done with Arsenal. \n\"It's interesting see they highlighted the fact that he speaks Portuguese, he speaks Spanish and his native English - and the fact that he's been in a variety of roles.\n\"I think sometimes it is good to get people from outside. You get fresh ideas. A different way of doing things can be really good. You get different pair of eyes on everything.\n\"It is part of this overall 2030 refresh that the club are doing. I know they've got a new head of technology coming in, so it'll be interesting to see how that develops as well. An exciting period coming up.\"\n  11. \"I don't believe in words,\" said Vitor Pereira, looking for the right ones to explain how he would pull Wolves up from their bad start.\n\"In football, you increase the level if you work on the pitch with the players.\"\nPerhaps the most important week of the season for Wolves will be one in which we don't see the players until the end of it.\nAfter four games without a point, there is a great deal of work to be done. Whatever other problems his team has, the evidence of those games is that Pereira's players have the appetite to do it. They are, by common consent, doing their best.\nOn Saturday night, Pereira was eager to get on with that work.\n\"Next week will be the first week that we work together as a squad to prepare for a match. It's the first week that I will have chance to go on the pitch, to show them, to work, repetition after repetition, on the pitch and not in videos or with words. I believe football is not about words, it's about work.\"\nQuite - although such problems are not unique to Wolves.\nJust as clubs have been building up their analysis teams to examine every step they and their opponents take, the time available to act on the findings - at least in the traditional, boots-on-the-training-ground way - seems more limited than ever. \nSome 15 members of Pereira's squad were away with national teams during the break, a club record number, and many travelled long distances. \nHe explained: \"In the end, we prepared this game against \nHe did nevertheless try some new things. Ladislav Krejci started his first game in midfield, marking a change of shape, and later moved into the back three, looking adept in both roles.\nMost eye-catching was the switch of the wing-backs \u2013 Hugo Bueno and Rodrigo Gomes having been two of the eight at home \u2013 and both were among the brighter Wolves performers. \"Tactically and strategically, we worked the last two weeks with Hugo and Rodrigo, to play with opposite foot\u2026 and I think that was a good decision,\" said Pereira.\nPereira, a former teacher, will have confidence that his instruction will help his team to improve. By his own account, this will be an intense week.\nIf his efforts have not resulted in Wolves moving off zero after they play \n  12. **Bournemouth have released computer-generated images to illustrate how they plan to expand Vitality Stadium, but when will work start on renovating?**\n**This is one of the questions sent in via our****form and we put it to Jordan Clark at BBC Radio Solent.**\nBournemouth have not given an exact start date for the renovations to begin but if everything goes to plan then they're hoping the work will start at some point between January and March 2026. \nThe club is currently working with Bournemouth, Christchurch and Poole Council on the planning and consultation phase, something Cherries chairman Bill Foley gave a positive update on in his programme notes before Saturday's win over \nIf planning permission is granted, then the club wants to start the redevelopment by installing a new perimeter fence and turnstiles, a new ticket office and a 'small-scale extension' to the West Stand, as well as an internal refurbishment of the East and West Stands. They hope to have that work completed by March 2026. \nAttention will then turn to building a new South Stand and infilling the four corners of the stadium by August 2026. \nThe final phase of the redevelopment should see the expansion of the North and East Stands, which the Cherries hope to start work on in the summer of 2027.\n_Ask Me Anything is a service dedicated to answering your questions._\n_We want to reward your time by telling you things you do not know and reminding you of things you do._\n  13. Summer signing Cristhian Mosquera continues to impress for Arsenal and again showed against Athletic Club why there is so much excitement around his early performances.\nThe 21-year-old defender has played a key role during the Gunners' start to the season and has had a big impact since deputising for William Saliba. \nMosquera made his debut in Arsenal's first home game of the season coming on at right-back for Jurrien Timber. \nHe was signed for his quality and his ability to play in multiple positions in the backline, but it is his performances at centre-back which have made supporters and those around the club take notice of his potential.\nMikel Arteta said Mosquera is going to \"push\" both Gabriel and Saliba for their position throughout the season and that the Spain Under-21 international \"wants it a lot\".\nMosquera again displayed his ability on the ball and and stayed calm in the opening 20 minutes, when a vociferous atmosphere had Arsenal under pressure.\nHe is an extremely physical defender who relishes duels with strikers - something Arteta values highly. \nHe is also quick, which allows him to recover when facing counter-attacks. Moreover, his versatility means he will be in line for a lot of game time this season.\nThe squad depth Arsenal have built is going to a big asset as they try to win a trophy for the first time since 2020.\nMosquera being good enough to be able to play in these games so early in the campaign means Saliba's absence has not been felt as much as it might have been previously.\nThat is no slight on Mosquera, who has shown early on in his Arsenal career he has the potential to be a first-choice starting centre-back in years to come.\n  14. \"There are connections with Sir Bobby Robson that we fully embrace,\" the Newcastle United head coach said before Thursday's game against Barcelona. \"That's what makes it such a special thing.\"\nHow fitting, then, that Sir Bobby's son, Mark, will be at St James' Park to see two of his father's former clubs meet in the Champions League.\n\"I wish Dad was alive to be there,\" he said. \"He would love it.\"\nThese were the sorts of occasions Sir Bobby relished as a manager. Not only at Newcastle but Barcelona, too.\nSir Bobby walked into a divided city, following predecessor Johan Cruyff's departure, in 1996, but led Barcelona to the Cup Winners' Cup, Copa del Rey and Spanish Super Cup.\nHe later went on to manage Newcastle, his boyhood club, and took the black-and-whites from the relegation zone to Europe's top table.\n\"Dad had incredible toughness to fight cancer and take on jobs,\" Mark said. \"I don't know how he did it.\"\nWhen Sir Bobby faced cancer for the fifth and final time, his oncologist, Professor Plummer, asked him if he knew anyone who could help raise \u00a3500,000 to equip a new cancer drug trials centre at the Northern Centre for Cancer Care in Newcastle.\nAlthough Sir Bobby was gravely ill, he put himself forward to launch a charity in his name, referring to it as his last and greatest team.\nThe former England manager went on to officially open the Sir Bobby Robson Cancer Trials Research Centre in 2009.\nPlans have now been submitted for an even more ambitious project, the Sir Bobby Robson Institute, a proposed \u00a330m research and treatment facility.\nFunded by the foundation, it would pioneer more ground-breaking innovation in cancer treatment and significantly increase the number of clinical trials available for patients across the North East, North Cumbria and North Yorkshire.\nSupporters have already raised \u00a320m and the charity is seeking the remaining \u00a310m needed.\n\"The two worlds of medicine and sport are coming together and hopefully creating something quite special.\" Mark added.\n  15. Chief football writer Phil McNulty has been answering your questions on all things Premier League.\nFlorian Wirtz's form is going under the radar a bit. For \u00a3116m, you want an instant impact. A handful of games in and he hasn't produced one standout performance yet. At what stage do we start to question his Premier League ability?\nHe has been quiet, but I actually thought there were real signs of Florian Wirtz settling in for Liverpool at \nIt's early days and even the best players need time to settle and fit into a new team. I certainly would not be questioning his Premier League ability. I am sure he will come good and thought the signs were there at Turf Moor.\n  16. Watch former Manchester City goalkeeper Shay Given and former Premier League striker Chris Sutton discuss the club's current goalkeeper situation following the arrivals of James Trafford and Gianluigi Donnarumma over the summer.\n\"James Trafford's a brilliant goalkeeper,\" Given told BBC Radio 5 Live's Monday Night Club.\n\"In the year of a World Cup, I think Pep's given him the full sales pitch. \n\"Fast forward two weeks and the big man Donnarumma comes in from Italy and he's parked up for the season.\n  17. Wolves hit a grim milestone on Saturday. A 1-0 loss at \nVitor Pereira's message is clear - he has not had time with his full squad. This week is his first real chance to drill tactics with everyone present.\nOn the pitch, it feels like last season. Individual errors. Sloppy passing. Poor choices in big moments. Too many soft goals.\nGary O'Neil had a more settled, experienced group than Pereira has now. Wolves pushed their transfer business late to stretch a tight budget, which led to seven first-team departures and six arrivals.\nThe result is a team learning on the job while the league shows no mercy.\nThere are fixes within reach. Pereira improved the defending when he first arrived; those gains can return with a proper training week and a settled XI. Tighten the shape out of possession. Cut cheap giveaways in build-up. Move the ball faster through midfield to find runners early. Be sharper on set pieces with clear roles and aggression. And find an attacking spark to turn pressure into shots on target.\nFor all the good work and credit Pereira earned when he came in, Wolves have not won a league game since April and have only one win if you include cup matches and friendlies.\nPressure is mounting, the fans are restless, and three of the next five fixtures are against promoted sides. These games will define Pereira's future and Wolves' season.\nLeeds is a pivotal game, for belief as much as points, and it must be won.\n  18. We asked for your views on whether Bruno Fernandes is undroppable from the Manchester United team, and whether the captain fits into Ruben Amorim's preferred 3-4-2-1 formation.\nWhen Kobbie Mainoo came on and Bruno Fernandes pushed up into the number 10 position he was more comfortable and looked more dangerous. Apart from his passing accuracy, which was poor throughout the match. As a defender it's easy to see that he's a liability, not strong in the tackle and doesn't see danger. It's very simple - play him in an advanced position.\nFernandes is the most consistent player United have. There is no way he can be dropped. Amorim has not been able to get the best out of rest of the players in the team.\nIn hindsight, we should have taken the huge offer for Bruno [from Saudi Pro League club Al-Hilal] and run to the bank with it. It's sad it's come to this but he's holding us back, as opposed to leading us forward. Each passing game only highlights further that once again our midfield is in dire need of support.\nIf you have a player who is world class in his favoured position then why would you, unless you do not understand the fundamentals of football, play him out of position?\nFernandes needs to be dropped. He was very poor on Sunday, as he has been for a long time. Why can't United make any dead balls count, or for that matter any crosses?\nWe do not have a squad that suits Amorim's preferred formation and, given the recent transfer window, that is shocking. Manuel Ugarte is the closest to the type of mobile midfielder needed, but he isn't quite good enough. Fernandes can't play that role. Amorim has to accept this and play a style that suits his squad. If he can't change then I'm afraid he must go.\n  19. Wolves have lost their first four games of a league season for the first time in their history.\nOf the previous 17 teams to lose their first four games of a Premier League season, eight have survived and nine have been relegated - essentially a coin flip.\nHowever, such a bad start has been far more costly in recent years, with just one of the past five teams to do so staying up. That was \n  20. Manchester United have already suffered a humiliating Carabao Cup defeat by League Two Grimsby in the opening weeks of the 2025-26 campaign.\nAlarmingly they have also managed only two goals from open play, while losing twice in their opening four league fixtures - with four points their poorest return at this stage since 1992-93 under Sir Alex Ferguson.\nBy then, though, Ferguson already had some credit in the bank having won the FA Cup, League Cup and European Cup Winners' Cup, while he guided United to a runners-up league finish in his first full season (1987-88).\nIn contrast, Amorim's 36% win rate across all competitions is the worst of any permanent United manager since World War Two and his win record is a dismal 26% in the league.\nOf the 17 sides who have been in the Premier League throughout since Amorim's tenure began, his United team have the worst record - alongside \n\"Quite a lot of league seasons that is relegation form,\" said former Manchester United striker Wayne Rooney.\n\"What is important when you're trying to implement a new style is you win games as well while you're doing that.\"\nRooney also echoed comments made by other former players now working in the media when he addressed Amorim's insistence on deploying two central midfielders, often against opposition sides featuring three.\n\"I have had my time as a manager, and I know how it works, and I know how it is when someone else looks and critiques your formation. I can understand that, but it is so obvious,\" Rooney added.\n\"If you're struggling, you have to put three in midfield and give yourself a chance to compete.\"\n  21. Match of the Day commentator at the Vitality Stadium\nI don't think I was alone in considering Bournemouth's deadline day signing of Veljko Milosavljevic as 'one for the future', given he is just 18 and had a mere 27 senior appearances for Red Star Belgrade.\nBecause Bournemouth didn't want to take any risks with Bafode Diakite, who I was told was not 100%, the stage was set for Milosavljevic to become the club's youngest player - and the youngest Serb - to start a Premier League match.\nAndoni Iraola's response when I asked him pre-match if Milosavljevic was ready to play at this level was: \"I'm not sure.\" The honest answer will have come from only having worked with the teenager for a couple of days as a result of him being away with Serbia Under-21s.\nThe biggest praise has to be for his mentality. The only visible sign of nerves was the slightly awkward pre-game dressing room photo posted on \nAs for his performance, I wouldn't go as far as saying he is the complete package of a modern, ball-playing centre-back yet, but he was more than comfortable playing out from the back and slotted in perfectly alongside Marcos Senesi.\nClearly the quicker of the two centre-halves, Milosavljevic was more effective in dealing with Brighton's pace in behind. He can do the ugly stuff too. Despite his boyish looks, Milosavljevic more than held his own when dealing with the physicality and guile of the experienced Danny Welbeck.\nDescribed as \"one of the biggest talents in Serbian football\" by media in his homeland, I'm reluctant to add to the hype train after a sample size of one Premier League game.\nI'm more inclined to echo the more measured assessment of match-winner Antoine Semenyo when I asked him about his new team-mate's debut: \"Solid - did everything right. A great start for him and many more to come\".\n  22. Some players found out about Nuno Esprito Santo's exit this week from their team mates, shocked messages and phone calls going around with many on international duty. \nNuno was popular, he fostered a unity in the squad and club which helped push their Champions League challenge last season. \nAnge Postecoglou must harness that to drive the club and squad on again. It will not be lost from within a close-knit squad and the new manager will surely recognise that. \nThe former Australia boss, though, is usually quiet and reserved initially, preferring to get ready for business and enjoying his own space. \nNick Montgomery, Mile Jedinak and Sergio Raimundo have joined as assistants along with Rob Burch as goalkeeping coach - having worked with Postecoglou at Tottenham - and they are likely to be the link with the rest of the staff, rather than the manager himself. \nNot to say Postecoglou will ignore others but he is there to work, professional, direct and focused. \nThose close to him have described him as honest, a good man, and unapologetic about how he wants to play. \nHe will drive them on, he tells players they will be the ones on top if they will follow him there - one of the reasons for his winning in his second season statement. \nIn his two years at Celtic he won two Scottish titles, two Scottish Cups and a League Cup, joining the club after they had lost the title to Rangers.\nHe took them back to the to the Champions League and performed well in a 3-0 defeat to Real Madrid in Glasgow in September 2022. \nThe hosts hit the post and had a number of chances before Madrid scored three times in the second half. \nYet the performance itself was not enough for Postecoglou who told his side, despite the level of opposition, there should not be a ceiling for them. \nHe told the squad he did not buy that Real Madrid were the superstars, he did not want to accept defeat. He wanted to win rather than just getting praise for playing well. \nIt was a good first half against one of the best teams in the world and those at Celtic at the time were pleasantly surprised by Postecoglou's stance. Reputations did not matter and he will look to drive Forest in the same way. \n  23. Ange Postecoglou has told BBC Radio Nottingham he wants to deliver a \"generational moment\" as Forest boss.\nSpeaking to Colin Fray, Postecoglou explained: \"I want the fans to dream and to almost bring to reality everything they dreamed for. The only trepidation is you might let them down but I'd much rather that than kind of fear success might come our way. I'd love that while I am here I bring a generational moment to this football club. It would mean everything I am passionate about is realised and long after I am gone there's the smallest of footprints in this football club made by me.\n\"I always want to make an impact at any club I am at. I think the only way you make an impact is to win things and creating moments that will outlast your tenure. That is my ambition at this club is to do something that hasn't been done for a long time or maybe done before. The intention is, the club is on an upward trajectory, in a good place, there are possibilities of making that real in terms of tangible success.\"\nIn a wide-ranging discussion, Postecoglou explained he thinks the Forest squad has the attributes to adapt to his style of play, stating: \"Yes it's a different way a little bit and a little more aggressive in its approach. When I look at this squad I see an exciting squad that can play expansive football and be effective. I don't think it's such a far reach.\"\n\n\n",

  "synthesis": "### Executive Summary\nThe latest UEFA Champions League results are not explicitly detailed in the provided resources, which predominantly focus on other sports. However, the broader context of ongoing competitive seasons in football, such as the Premier League and other tournaments, indicates a vibrant atmosphere in football, with significant matches impacting team standings and strategies.\n\n### Key Findings\n- No specific Champions League results were found in the resources, suggesting a need for direct sources for Champions League updates.\n- Other competitive football fixtures, such as the Premier League, are currently taking place, influencing team dynamics and fan engagement.\n- Major narratives in football include Manchester United's recent victory over Chelsea and Fulham's Premier League match against Brentford, showcasing the competitive landscape outside the Champions League.\n- The resources highlight ongoing developments in various sports, indicating a busy sports calendar that may divert attention from the Champions League.\n\n### Detailed Analysis\nThe resources provided do not contain direct information regarding the latest UEFA Champions League results, which limits the ability to provide specific outcomes or analyses related to that tournament. However, they do reflect a broader engagement with football through Premier League matches, underlining that while Champions League games are significant, domestic leagues continue to capture a considerable amount of attention.\n\nFor instance, the Premier League has seen intense competition, with Manchester United's recent victory over Chelsea being particularly noteworthy. This match not only affects the standings in the league but also has implications for team morale and future fixtures. Fulham's ongoing match against Brentford further illustrates the busy schedule of football, as teams gear up for critical encounters that can influence their overall performance in the league and indirectly affect their Champions League aspirations.\n\nAdditionally, the absence of Champions League results highlights a potential gap in the resources regarding comprehensive football coverage. Fans and analysts alike often rely on real-time updates from dedicated sports news platforms, which might not always encompass all major tournaments simultaneously.\n\n### Future Implications or Trends\nAs the football season progresses, the Champions League will likely remain a focal point for clubs aiming for European glory. The interplay between domestic league performance and Champions League aspirations will become increasingly pronounced as teams face pivotal matches that can determine their trajectories. Furthermore, the growing popularity of football analytics may lead to more rigorous coverage of team performance in major tournaments, enhancing the connection between domestic results and international competitions.\n\nWith the ongoing development of football narratives and the potential for emerging rivalries, fans should expect a thrilling conclusion to the season. Moreover, as clubs navigate injuries, transfers, and tactical adjustments, the landscape of both domestic and European competitions will continue to evolve. This dynamic environment suggests that coverage of Champions League results and implications will become increasingly critical as the tournament progresses and approaches its climax. \n\nIn summary, while specific Champions League results are not highlighted in the provided resources, the football landscape remains vibrant, with significant implications for teams engaged in both domestic and international competitions.",
